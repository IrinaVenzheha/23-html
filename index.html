          <strong><span>ZEN Cottages</span></strong>
          were founded by architect Andrew Shimmer and his wife
          Carol. They wanted to create<br> classically-designed, efficient, and
          prefabricated structures that could be easily moved, contracted,<br>
          expanded, and sold while maintaining both integrity and aesthetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company respects the natural environment and deeply cares about
          it. Therefore, we do our best<br> to use building constructions and
          delivery systems that are flexible and have minimal impact on the<br>
          land they occupy.
